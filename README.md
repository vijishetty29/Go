## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of practice problems and algorithms implemented in Go. The goal is to provide a hands-on approach to learning and mastering Go by solving problems and understanding how different algorithms work.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you will need to have Go installed on your machine. You can download and install Go from the official [Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/go-practice-problems.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd go-practice-problems
```

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories: `practice-problems` and `algorithms`.

- `practice-problems/`: Contains various Go practice problems.
- `algorithms/`: Contains implementations of different algorithms in Go.

Each directory contains multiple subdirectories, each representing a specific problem or algorithm. Within each subdirectory, you will find the Go source files and, if applicable, a README file explaining the problem or algorithm.

## Practice Problems

The `practice-problems` directory includes a variety of problems to solve. Each problem has its own subdirectory with the following structure:

```
practice-problems/
  ├── problem-name/
  │   ├── main.go
  │   ├── README.md
  │   └── solution.go
```

- `main.go`: Contains the initial code template and problem statement.
- `README.md`: Provides a detailed description of the problem, including input and output examples.
- `solution.go`: Contains the solution to the problem.

Feel free to try solving the problems on your own before looking at the solutions provided.

## Algorithms

The `algorithms` directory includes implementations of various algorithms. Each algorithm has its own subdirectory with the following structure:

```
algorithms/
  ├── algorithm-name/
  │   ├── main.go
  │   ├── README.md
  │   └── implementation.go
```

- `main.go`: Contains example usage of the algorithm.
- `README.md`: Provides a detailed explanation of the algorithm, including its complexity and use cases.
- `implementation.go`: Contains the implementation of the algorithm.

Study the provided implementations to understand how each algorithm works and try to implement them yourself.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any practice problems or algorithms you'd like to add, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your contribution.
3. Add your practice problem or algorithm to the appropriate directory.
4. Create a pull request with a detailed description of your contribution.
